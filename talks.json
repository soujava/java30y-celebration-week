    "title": "Beyond LLMs: Architecting Enterprise AI with Symbolic Reasoning and Executable Knowledge Models",
    "description": "As Generative AI reshapes modern software, the enterprise faces a new challenge: how to adopt LLMs while ensuring predictable, explainable, and compliant outcomes. This session outlines a practical strategy that combines the flexibility of LLMs with the structure of Symbolic AI to meet enterprise requirements.\n\nA very powerful approach is leveraging Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) through standards like DMN and BPMN, which act as both knowledge models and runnable artifacts. Backed by the open-source Apache KIE (including Drools and jBPM engines), these models provide transparent, auditable, and deterministic behavior.\n\nThis hybrid architecture combines the strengths of Statistical and Symbolic AI—unlocking innovation while delivering the control enterprises demand. If you're designing systems that must reason, comply, and explain — not just predict — this session will help you confidently move from experimentation to production.",

    "title": "Domain-Driven Design: Manage Data With with Jakarta Data and Jakarta NoSQL",
    "description": "Managing data access in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) applications can be challenging, especially when working with different database types, like relational and NoSQL. This talk explores how to simplify that complexity using the power of two modern Jakarta specifications: Jakarta NoSQL and Jakarta Data.\n\nJakarta NoSQL and Jakarta Data helps simplify data access, making it easier to implement domain-focused repositories, integrate ubiquitous language, and naturally align business semantics with your code.\n\nThis session is framework-agnostic but will showcase examples running on Quarkus, a cloud-native Java platform optimized for developer productivity. What you’ll walk away with:\n\n- A practical understanding of the difference between DAOs and domain-driven repositories.\n\n- How Jakarta NoSQL maps Java entities to NoSQL structures.\n\n- How Jakarta Data empowers expressive queries aligned with business logic.\n\n- How to apply these tools in modern Java apps to bridge the gap between code and business.",

    "description": "GraalVM has been around for a while, and more and more developers and teams are using it to run Java applications faster, more efficiently, and more securely. According to the latest 'State of Spring' survey, 37% of Spring users either already run applications natively compiled GraalVM in production, or are currently evaluating it, and 31% more have such plans.\n\nFor those who haven't moved to GraalVM yet though, the questions and concerns are usually similar: how hard is it to migrate? Can I use my libraries and tools? Can I monitor such native applications?\n\nWhat about using the latest Java features? In this hands-on session, we'll talk about all the practical aspects of building and running applications with GraalVM, tooling, monitoring, and using popular libraries, and cover common questions that we get from users.",

    "description": "I remember that when Siri appeared on iPhones, the first thing I wanted to try was to make 2 Siri talk to each other; it wasn't very convincing. It was during the same period when Second Life was very popular, and I spent many hours there. Anyway, virtual worlds with autonomous agents have always fascinated me.However, it was very complex to develop such architecture oneself unless you were an expert in artificial intelligence and machine learning. But the surge of generative AI has changed the game by bringing a plethora of libraries that abstract all this complexity while offering unprecedented artificial intelligence power. In this talk, I will present how I managed to develop a virtual civilisation that created its own traditions, games, but also fauna and flora. All this starting from a simple context definition. Challenges such as managing the memories of each avatar, inter-agent interaction have been greatly facilitated by the use of libraries like Langchain4j, as well as the Quarkus stack. I invite you to discover this exciting world that led me to many sleepless nights because it was so thrilling and outside my comfort zone. A few slides but mostly a lot of live coding and the opportunity to interact during the presentation with this virtual civilisation.",

    "description": "It's impressive how widely known DDD is—and yet, how rarely it's applied effectively in real-world systems. One of the most common pitfalls? Not knowing where to start. Many developers jump straight into tactical patterns without understanding that DDD is first and foremost a strategic discipline. It's not just about code—it's about aligning software with business.\n\nBefore touching implementation, we must understand the domains and subdomains, define bounded contexts, and establish a clear ubiquitous language. Only then should we move into tactical modeling: entities, aggregates, repositories, and so on.\n\nTo support implementation, I'll also present JMolecules, a powerful tool that brings architectural clarity to code. It integrates seamlessly with tools like ArchUnit, letting you validate architecture rules just like unit tests.",
